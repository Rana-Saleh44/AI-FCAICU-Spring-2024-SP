◼ Agents and Environments
◼ How Agents Should Act
◼ Rational Agents                                          percepts
◼ Task Environment of Agent
◼ Structure of Agents

rational agent(program)-> making decisions aka reasoning->goal ->based on available info and understanding the environment.

perceive be aware of something through sense" sight, hearing ,etc"

The Big AI Picture -> agent (exist in an environment and perceive, act, and learn)
1: Sense from the environment.
2: Reason inside it!! see slide 2 arrow.
3: Act in the environment.
4: Get Feedback form the environment.
5: Learn "agent".

An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
Human agent has:
– Eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors;
– Hands, legs, mouth, and other body parts for actuators.
◼ Robotic agent has:
– Cameras and infrared range finders for sensors;
– Various motors for actuators.
◼ Software agent:
– Receives keystrokes, file contents, and network packets as inputs;
– Displays on screen, writes files, and sends net packets as outputs.

Agents interact with environments through sensors and actuators.

◼ Mathematically, an agent’s behavior is described by
the agent function that maps from percept histories to
actions:
                   [ f: P* → A ]

agent function -> implemented by -> agent program -> running on -> agent architecture -> to produce -> f
                   agent = architecture + program
 

example:
Vacuum-cleaner world
◼ Environment: just two locations – squares A and B
◼ Percepts: which square it is in (location) and whether
there is dirt in the square (contents), e.g., [A, Dirty]
◼ Actions: move left, move right, suck up the dirt, or do
nothing
◼ Agent function: if the current square is dirty, then
suck; otherwise move to the other square.


How Agents Should Act
◼ A rational agent is one that does “the right thing”
based on what it can perceive and the actions it can
perform.
◼ We use the term performance measure for the how —
the criteria that determine how successful an agent is.
◼ The when of evaluating performance is also important.
