AI (rapidly) replacing ‘white collar’ jobs-> office environment 
(Robots have been replacing ‘blue collar’ jobs for awhile)-> manual work

definitions of AI fall
into four categories:
– Systems that think like humans.(Cognitive Modeling *see this part 24) -> decision making, problem solving and learning.
– Systems that act like humans. (Turing Test)
– Systems that think rationally.(Laws of Thought *see this part 25)-> perceive, reason and act.
– Systems that act rationally. -> intelligent agents.

intelligent agents: are programs that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve their goals effectively.

Acting Humanly: Turing Test
Turing: intelligent behavior as the
ability to achieve human-level performance in all
cognitive tasks"mental activities such as problem-solving, decision-making, and memory recall", sufficient to fool an interrogator"a person who interview someone in order to gather info".
> passes the test if the interrogator cannot
tell if there is a computer or a human at the other end.
Suggested major components of AI: " realted to the Turing Test"
– Natural Language Processing to enable it to communicate
successfully in English (or some other human language);
– Knowledge Representation to store information provided
before or during the interrogation;
– Automated Reasoning to use the stored information to
answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
– Machine Learning to adapt to new circumstances and to
detect and extrapolate patterns;
– Computer Vision to perceive objects, and...
– Robotics to move them about...

This course is about designing rational agents.

Fundamental Techniques of AI
Knowledge Representation:
– Characteristics of good data representation techniques:
» Captures general situation rather than being overly specific
» Understandable by the people who provide it
» Easily modified to handle errors, changes in data, and changes in perception
» Of general use
Search:
– Base-level versus meta-level reasoning
» How can we reason about what step to take next (in reaching the
goal)?
» How much do we reason before acting?

AI techniques are used in many common applications:
– Intelligent user interfaces
– Search Engines
– Spell/grammar checkers
– Context sensitive help systems
– Medical diagnosis systems
– Regulating/Controlling hardware devices and processes
(e.g, in automobiles)
– Voice/image recognition (more generally, pattern
recognition)
– Scheduling systems (airlines, hotels, manufacturing)
– Error detection/correction in electronic communication
– Program verification / compiler and programming language
design
– Web search engines / Web spiders
– Web personalization and Recommender systems
(collaborative/content filtering)
– Personal agents
– Customer relationship management
– Credit card verification in e-commerce / fraud detection
– Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases
– Computer games

Locomotion:
the movement or navigation capabilities of artificial agents, such as robots or virtual characters, within a simulated or real-world environment.

Robot Vision:
objects recognition.
face recognition.
speech or sound recognition.
texture recognition.

Some Sub-fields of AI
◼Problem solving
◼Logical reasoning
– Prove things by manipulating database of facts
– Theorem proving
◼Automatic Programming
– Writing computer programs given some sort of description
– Some success with semi-automated methods
– Some error detection systems
– Automatic program verification
◼Language understanding and semantic modeling
◼ Pattern Recognition
– Computer-aided identification of objects/shapes/sounds
– Needed for speech and picture understanding
– Requires signal acquisition, feature extraction, ...
– Data mining and Information Retrieval
◼ Expert Systems and Knowledge-based Systems
– Designers often called knowledge engineers
– Translate things that an expert knows and rules that an expert
uses to make decisions into a computer program
– Problems include
» Knowledge acquisition (or how do we get the information)
» Explanation (of the answers)
» Knowledge models (what do we do with info)
» Handling uncertainty
◼ Planning, Robotics and Vision
◼ Machine Learning and Neural Networks
– Can we “remember” solutions, rather than recalculating
them?
– Can we learn additional facts from present data?
– Can we model the physical aspects of the brain?
– Classification and clustering
◼ Non-monotonic Reasoning
– Truth maintenance systems
